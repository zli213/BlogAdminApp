Guide to Handlebars Partials in this Project:

Handlebars is a templating language that allows us to build semantic templates effectively with no frustration. One of
its powerful features is 'partials'.

A 'partial' in Handlebars is a snippet of HTML that can be reused in multiple places. This allows us to avoid
duplication, enhance readability, and ease maintenance.

Partials are registered using the following syntax:

Handlebars.registerPartial('partialName', 'partial template')

Once registered, they can be used within other templates using the following syntax:

{{> partialName}}

In this project, we use partials extensively for common sections of the website. Here are some examples:

{{! This is the header partial that contains the website's header section. It includes the navigation menu and logo. }}
{{> header}}

{{! This is the footer partial that contains the website's footer section. It includes copyright information and links
to other pages. }}
{{> footer}}

Please consider using and extending the existing partials before creating new sections from scratch. If you need to
create a new partial, remember to register it before using it. --}}
